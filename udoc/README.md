# Welcome to the uDoc document generator for Coq

This is a fork of CoqDoc geared to the production of jsCoq documents from `.v` files.

It assumes a `jscoq` folder with a jscoq build. Such builds can be
downloaded from here:

## Ideas

- The Coq `Comments` command could be used?
- The hide keywords feature could be useful in a different form.
- Recognize notations?
